This could include matching two or more data points you provide when you submit a request with two or more data points that are already maintained by us.\n\nIn accordance with the verification process set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), SAP will require a more stringent verification process for deletion requests, or for Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, to minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data. If SAP must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by SAP, SAP will only use it for the purposes of verifying your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights, or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.\n\nSAP will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law.\nCalifornia Do Not Track Disclosure\nWe use cookies to deliver personalized content, to save you having to re-enter your password repeatedly, to keep track of your shopping cart, and to tailor our information offerings to how you and others use the site.
